# DnD-API

A backend API for CMSC 508 final project

Documentation found in the [wiki](https://github.com/r-best/DnD-API/wiki/API-Reference)

All routes that take inputs only allow letters, numbers, hyphens, and spaces. If your request includes anything else you WILL get a 402 as a response. This is not a mistake. You owe me 20$ for trying to SQL inject my API.
